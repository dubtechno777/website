        <h2 class="title-xl mb-m">The Science of Space</h2>
        <p class="text-m">Why timing is everything in reverb and delay</p>
      </div>

      <div class="content content--left mb-l">
        <h3 class="text-accent mb-s">The Problem with Guesswork:</h3>
        <p class="text-s mb-l">
          Ever set a reverb or delay by ear and wonder why it feels off? Without knowing the exact
          milliseconds, your reverbs can wash out the mix and delays might drift away from the rhythm.
          Guessing timing often leads to cluttered, unbalanced tracks — and nobody wants that.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-accent mb-s">How Pros Approach Timing:</h3>
        <p class="text-s mb-l">
          Experienced producers don’t rely on luck — they calculate. Turning BPM into precise milliseconds
          ensures that each reverb tail and delay echo hits perfectly. Timing becomes a tool, not a gamble.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-accent mb-s">Precision is Everything:</h3>
        <p class="text-s mb-l">
          With a BPM to MS Calculator, you get exact numbers for pre-delay, decay, and delay times.
          At 120 BPM, a quarter-note delay is 500ms — easy, right? Precision lets you craft spaces that feel natural,
          whether it’s a subtle ambience behind vocals or a massive, lush reverb for pads.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-accent mb-s">From Numbers to Musical Feeling:</h3>
        <p class="text-s">
          The magic happens when you turn technical calculations into musical choices. 
          Using accurate timings as your base, you can shape reverb and delay to enhance emotion, groove, and energy. 
          The BPM to MS Calculator bridges the gap between cold numbers and expressive sound, letting your tracks breathe while staying perfectly in sync.

  <!-- FAQ SECTION -->
  <section class="section">
    <div class="container">
      <div class="content content--center mb-l">
        <h2 class="title-xl mb-m">FAQ</h2>
        <p class="text-m">
          All your questions about calculating precise reverb and delay times answered. Learn how timing transforms
          your mixes and why professional producers rely on accurate BPM-to-millisecond calculations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="content content--left mb-l">
        <h3 class="text-accent mb-s">How do I convert BPM to milliseconds?</h3>
        <p class="text-s mb-l">
          Converting BPM to milliseconds is the foundation of precise timing. 
          The simple formula ms = 60000 / BPM gives the duration of a quarter note. 
          From there, you can calculate dotted notes, triplets, and any note value to synchronize delay and reverb perfectly with your track. 
          Using exact millisecond values eliminates guesswork, ensures tight rhythmic alignment, and allows you to create professional, polished mixes where every element sits perfectly in the tempo of the song.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-accent mb-s">What is pre-delay and why does it matter?</h3>
        <p class="text-s mb-l">
          Pre-delay is the short gap between the dry sound and the start of the reverb tail. 
          It controls the sense of space, helping vocals, instruments, and pads to remain clear while adding depth. 
          Calculating pre-delay in milliseconds ensures your reverbs feel natural and musical. 
          With the BPM to MS Calculator, you can match pre-delay to your song’s tempo accurately, making your mix sound professional whether you’re working on subtle ambience, large halls, or lush, expansive spaces.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-accent mb-s">How do dotted notes and triplets affect delay timing?</h3>
        <p class="text-s mb-l">
          Dotted notes increase a note's duration by half, and triplets divide a beat into three equal parts. 
          These rhythmic variations allow your delays to create interesting textures and grooves. 
          Calculating exact millisecond values for dotted notes and triplets ensures your echoes sync perfectly with your music. 
          This level of precision allows you to craft rhythmic delays that complement the feel of your track, making them an integral part of the composition rather than just an effect.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-accent mb-s">Can I use this for any genre?</h3>
        <p class="text-s mb-l">
          Absolutely. Accurate timing is universal across all musical styles—techno, house, pop, rock, drum & bass, or experimental electronic music. 
          While each genre has typical BPM ranges, calculating precise pre-delay, decay, and delay values ensures your effects always sound musical, professional, and perfectly timed. 
          With the BPM to MS Calculator, you can adapt your timing choices to any style, from subtle textures to complex rhythmic patterns.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-accent mb-s">Why is precision important in mixing?</h3>
        <p class="text-s">
          Mixing without precise timing often leads to muddiness, rhythm clashes, or effects that feel out of place. 
          Calculating exact pre-delay, decay, and delay values allows you to achieve clarity, depth, and groove in your mix. 
          The BPM to MS Calculator transforms technical measurements into actionable musical decisions, giving you full control over your sonic space. 
          Precision lets your tracks breathe, sit well together, and maintain a professional polish across all elements of your production.
